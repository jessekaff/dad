## Getting Started

Initial decisions will be documented when you run:
- `plan-product` - Documents initial tech stack and architecture decisions
- `analyze-product` - Infers decisions from existing codebase

As your project evolves, new decisions should be added here to maintain a clear history of "why" things were built a certain way.

## Why Track Decisions?

- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand the "why"
- **Consistency**: Ensure aligned decision-making
- **Learning**: Review past decisions to improve future ones
- **Documentation**: Maintain institutional knowledge
