# Task Specifications

> **Status**: No Tasks Yet
> **Create with**: `plan-task` command

## About This Folder

This folder will contain detailed specifications for features and tasks after you start planning them with DAD.

## What Gets Created Here

When you run `plan-task`, the AI will create files like:
- `user-auth-spec.md` - User authentication feature specification
- `payment-integration-spec.md` - Payment system specification
- `dashboard-redesign-spec.md` - UI redesign specification

Each spec includes:
- **User Stories**: What users want to accomplish
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation details
- **API Specifications**: Endpoints and data structures
- **Database Changes**: Schema modifications
- **Testing Strategy**: How to verify it works
- **Task Breakdown**: Step-by-step implementation plan

## Workflow

1. **Plan First**: `plan-task for [feature name]`
   - Creates detailed specification
   - Breaks down into subtasks
   - Defines acceptance criteria

2. **Execute Second**: `execute-task for [spec name]`
   - Implements the planned feature
   - Follows the specification
   - Creates tests and documentation

## Getting Started

To create your first task specification:

```
Tell your AI: "Run plan-task for user authentication"
```

The AI will:
1. Ask about requirements
2. Create a detailed spec
3. Break it into implementable tasks
4. Define success criteria
